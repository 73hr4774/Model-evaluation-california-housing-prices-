# California Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices in California using the California Housing dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which is a popular dataset for regression tasks. It contains information about various features of houses in California, such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, and population.

## Model

A Linear Regression model is used to predict house prices. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining portion.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the model:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) Score

## Results

The model achieved the following results on the test set:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.53 Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.53 R-squared (R²) Score: 0.61

## Visualization

The following plot shows the actual vs. predicted house prices:

The plot illustrates the relationship between the actual and predicted house prices, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
